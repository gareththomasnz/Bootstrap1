                        <p class="text-block">Broadly speaking, we use personal information
                        for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to

                        <p class="text-block">A cookie is a very small text document, which
                        often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
                        for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site
                        can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
                        browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by
                        other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you
                        may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies,
                        it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie
                        cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>
